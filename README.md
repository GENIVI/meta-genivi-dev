meta-genivi-dev: the Yocto layer for the GENIVI Development Platform
====================================================================

This layer can now be found as a subdirectory of [genivi-dev-platform.git](https://github.com/genivi/genivi-dev-platform/)
No more changes shall be made to this repository.

There are maintenance branches for critical fixes to older versions of the platform, which still use this as a submomdule.
Use branch [12.x](https://github.com/GENIVI/meta-genivi-dev/tree/12.x) for fixes to 12.x versions.

There is also a [11.x](https://github.com/GENIVI/meta-genivi-dev/tree/11.x) maintenance branch, but not recommended.  According to current policy, only one release is maintained behind the most recently released (except for known critical security fixes).  Community volunteers might of course emaintain more than that.  Since the release of GDP 13.0, version 11.0 went out of official maintenance.
